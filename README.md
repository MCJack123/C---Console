C++ Console
===========
Hello those of you that happen to come across this,
This program that is on the repo is a terminal program that I have written in C++. To run this program, you will need to download all the files to run the program. You will also need cURL, found at curl.haxx.se .

The simplified way of explaining how to run the console: 
Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (OS X or Linux). Type in "cd Downloads", but without the quotes. Type "cd C---Console-master", also without the quotes. Then type "g++ -o C++Console C++Console.cpp". To run the program after, go to your Downloads folder, then to the C---Console-master folder, then run C++Console.

The advanced way to explain how to run the console:
Open the command line, navigate to the C---Console-master folder, and compile C++Console.cpp. You can then run the compiled program to enter the command line.
(Note: You will need to use g++ to compile. If you use gcc, you will get a ton of problems and end up not being able to compile.)
Commands
==========
about
Gives information about the prompt

hello
A simple hello world program

help
A help program for the C++ console.

clear

installer
A command to install, update, and remove items. Current arguments:
    update
    Updates an app or the console. Current arguments:
        console
        Updates the console.


If you want to add a command, you can make "apps". An app is a compiled C++ class. For your app to be officialy supported with installer, login to GitHub with the email 'cppconsoleapps@gmail.com' and the password 'consoleapps'. Then add your compiled app to the folder for the system the compiled app is for (in the Compiled Apps folder in the Apps repo). If you want to add the source code, add it to the 'src' folder. Also add the name of your app to the Apps.txt file.
Have great simplified coding!
